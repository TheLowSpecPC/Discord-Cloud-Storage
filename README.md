After all that you need to first make 2 channels named whatever you like. One will be used to store the metadata and the other will be used to store the actual 20Mb chunks. <br />
 <br />
Next you need to copy your bot token and past it to the "token" variable in main.py, temp.py and dbot.py <br />
Then copy the Channel ID of the channel used to store the data and past it to the "channel" variable in dbot.py <br />
Finally copy the Channel ID of the channel use to store the metadata and past it to the "channel_flag" variable in main.py, temp.py and dbot.py <br />
 <br />
Also don't forget to install requirments.txt. <br />
Enjoy :)
